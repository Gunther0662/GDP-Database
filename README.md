The website was created to find average or note down the GDP in prices and tags. This makes the website to be able to store information relating the currency and the tag prices of items in a bank database. In many workplaces it is require to kkep track of how much a buissness is spending as well as how much product is being consume by the price tag and keeping track in an database. By creating this website I was able to see the corrilation of sequelize as well as the schema database to create a working table and input information into the datbase.
